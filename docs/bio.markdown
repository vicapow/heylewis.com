# Bio

Have you ever seen _Fried Green Tomatoes_? I grew up mainly near that cafe in Irondale, Alabama. In my 18th year, Homewood High School elected me Prom King. That was my peak I guess.

I went to University of Pittsburgh in 2005. I made a documentary about the Alabama State Constitution until 2007. I lived with families for eight months in Peru and Buenos Aires. Eventually I got a BS in Mathematics-Economics.

In 2010 I covered worked at a steel trade journal until I quit that job and made animations for small businesses.

In 2011 the University of Leeds gave me a scholarship to get a one-year MA in Transport Economics, because I'd made an animated series about congestion pricing. 

Now I'm getting my PhD in Transportation Engineering at UC Berkeley. My advisor is Carlos Daganzo and my research is about bottlenecks and the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram.
