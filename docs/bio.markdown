# Bio

Have you ever seen _Fried Green Tomatoes_? I grew up behind a Wal-Mart near that cafe in Irondale, Alabama. By 18 I was an Eagle Scout and Prom King, and my face had fully developed into the likeness of Audrey Tatou.

I went to University of Pittsburgh. I made a documentary about the Alabama State Constitution that Ken Burns wrote me a letter about. I lived with families for eight months in Peru and Buenos Aires. Eventually I got a BS in Mathematics-Economics.

In 2010 I covered worked at a steel trade journal. By nights I practiced Adobe After Effects until I quit that job and made animations for small businesses.

In 2011 the University of Leeds gave me a scholarship to get a one-year MA in Transport Economics, because I'd made an animated series about congestion pricing. My MA dissertation was about specifying income in discrete choice models.

Now I'm getting my PhD in Transportation Engineering at UC Berkeley. My advisor is Carlos Daganzo and my research is about bottlenecks and the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram.
