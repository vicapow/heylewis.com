Have you ever seen _Fried Green Tomatoes_? I grew up behind a Wal-Mart near that cafe in Irondale, Alabama. By 18 I was an Eagle Scout and Prom King, and my face had fully developed into the likeness of Audrey Tatou.

I went to University of Pittsburgh. I made a documentary about the Alabama State Constitution that Ken Burns wrote me a letter about. I lived with families for eight months in Peru and Buenos Aires. Eventually I got a BS in Mathematics-Economics, with an honors thesis about portraying economics visually.

In 2010 I covered pipe & tube for a steel trade journal. By nights I practiced Adobe After Effects until I quit that job and just made animations all day. I was a job creator; I was a poor person.

In 2011 the University of Leeds gave me a scholarship to get a one-year MA in Transport Economics, because I'd made an animated series about congestion pricing. My MA dissertation was about specifying income in discrete choice models.

Now I'm getting my MS/PhD in Transportation Engineering at UC Berkeley.
