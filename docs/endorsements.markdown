# Endorsements

###Forecasting
My Dad is a city planner who does natural hazard mitigation on the Gulf Coast. Maybe for that reason I'm
fascinated by forecasting...its difficulty and humanity's relative lack of interest in its accuracy.

[Bent Flyvbjerg](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/people/Pages/BentFlyvbjerg.aspx) says governments are mislead about the costs and benefits of large projects.
He's willing to [call people out](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/newsandevents/releases/Pages/Foolsandliars.aspx). 

[Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/) is famous for writing The Black Swan.  
And the [ludic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy) is a useful concept.

[Philip Tetlock](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1) is doing something about inaccurate
forecasts by founding the [Good Judgement Project](http://goodjudgmentproject.com/). A good [interview](http://edge.org/conversation/win-at-forecasting).


###Coding

[Sympy](http://sympy.org/en/index.html) replaces Mathematica with Python for free and uses cleaner syntax.

[Learn Latex in Seven Minutes](http://www.math.rug.nl/~ernst/latex/) actually takes longer than seven minutes.

[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) beautifies data.

[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) and [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) taught me coding.
Udacity is better for learning Python.

###Mindfulness

[Mindfulness for Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Dummies-Book-Shamash-Alidina/dp/0470660864) is the best intro.

[Chade-Meng Tang](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/01/technology/01google.html?_r=0), engineer at Google, stresses how easily you can incorporate
mindfulness into a conventionally successful life. Check out his [bestseller](http://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116924
although Mindfulness for Dummies goes more in-depth as a practical guide if you want to get serious.

[Jon Kabat-Zinn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nwwKbM_vJc), professor at U-Mass med school, helped bring mindfulness into modernity.

###Transportation & Urbanism

[Transportationist](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/levin031/transportationist/) is the one-stop shop for transport information. 

[Bus Rapid Transit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit) is the H&M of transit: you get about 75% of the quality
for 10% of the price. The best way to improve accessibility.

[Antiplanner](http://ti.org/antiplanner/), or Randal O'Toole of Cato, highlights failures.

[Market Urbanism](http://marketurbanism.com/) means inclusive cities.

###Motion Graphics

[Greyscale Gorilla](http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/) and [AETuts](http://ae.tutsplus.com/) taught me After Effects.

[Jr.caneste](http://vimeo.com/jrcanest) (Jorge Canedo Estrada) is my favorite animator even though it's intimidating that he's four years younger than me.

[AeScripts](http://aescripts.com/) has saved me more hours than the automobile. Check out [Ease and Whiz](http://aescripts.com/ease-and-wizz/) and
[Reposition Anchor Point](http://aescripts.com/repositionanchorpoint/).

###Entertainment

[Dave Eggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers), founder of McSweeney's and author of What is the What, A Heartbreaking Work
of Staggering Genius, and A Hologram for the King, is my favorite author if I put pretensions aside. He puts together
the [Best American Nonrequired Reading](http://www.hmhbooks.com/hmh/bestamerican/nonrequired) series--the Now That's What
I Call Music! of short literature.

[Mario Vargas Llosa](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2010/vargas_llosa-lecture_en.html), Peruvian nobel laureate,
writes about Latin America and friendship better than anyone. 
[La Ciudad y los Perros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_the_Hero) is the best portrayal of how awful kids can be.

Podcasts: I'm addicted to [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) and [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/). 
[Paul F. Tompkins](http://pft.libsyn.com/) is the funniest mimic on Earth. The [New Yorker Fiction Podcast](http://www.newyorker.com/online/podcasts/fiction)
makes you seem more intellectual.

Music: The Pixies, Deerhoof, Fidlar, Raekwon, GZA, Shakira

TV: The Wire, Bored to Death, New Girl, The League
