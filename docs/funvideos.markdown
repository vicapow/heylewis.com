###Andrew Carnegie Show
In 1919, as he lays upon his death bed, Andrew Carnegie longs for fond memories of being the most popular kid at college. Determined to recall pleasantry, he hatches a plan. He creates Carnegie-Mellon University.

He commissions George Washington Carver of Alabama to build a time machine. Using the time machine, he kidnaps himself at the age of 18. He travels to the year 2005 with his younger self. He drops off the younger Carnegie with instructions to enroll at CMU. 

The idea is that he will become popular since the school is named after him. Andrew Carnegie is rejected for admission to Carnegie-Mellon. Stranded in the future, he enrolls at the University of Pittsburgh.
