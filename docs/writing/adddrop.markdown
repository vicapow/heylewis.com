# Relationship Outlasts Add/Drop Period
Originally published in the [Th Pittiful News](http://www.pittifulnews.com)

The budding romance between Liz Olmstead and Jason Milikan passed a milestone Monday, as the relationship's add/drop period came to a close. While it is still possible to "withdraw" from the commitment, ending the relation-ship now entails consequences, including the loss of mutual friends.
The now-fomented relationship came as something of a surprise to Milikan. 
"I'm an engineer, and we don't have many elective friends, so I don't usually know people outside my major," said Milikan. "But this semester, I had a pretty light schedule, so I thought I'd try something a little out-of-the-ordinary for engineers…like dating.” 
Olmstead, however, anticipated a semi-permanent coupling by the date of Jan. 19th.
"I was sort of shopping around...trying to hang out with a couple of guys before add/drop ended, but I really liked Jason's unorthodox style. The other day, we went on a date outside," she said. "Plus, Jason fulfilled a requirement…"
 Olmstead then winked, smiled, and demonstrated an eight-inch gap with her hands. 
Sources close to Milikan say he will stick with the relationship, despite recent, more stressful developments.
"Yeah, Jay was complaining about all this reading that Liz assigned him like the day after add/drop...like The History of Love, by Nicole Krauss, but he just read some Amazon[.com] reviews and things turned out fine when she quizzed him on it," said Ray Ray Martin, a close friend of Milikan. "It's just unfair that they never tell you up front how much work the relationship is gonna be."
