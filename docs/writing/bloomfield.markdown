INS Struggles to Close Porous Oakland-Bloomfield Border
-Bloomfield Bridge-

It's a humid summer night, and Immigration and Naturalization Officers Marshall O'Brien and Terrance Cortez are dressed in fatigues and utility vests. The heat does not phase them.

"We've got a job to do," said O'Brien. "We're the only thing stopping Bloomfield from being completely overrun by students....puking, dancing, badgering people to registered to vote!"

The problem has been festering for years. Citing lower rents, quiet nights, and charming, elderly Italian neighbors as reasons for immigrating, more and more college students are daring the perilous trek across the Bloomfield Bridge from their traditional homeland of Oakland. The tide of students has Bloomfield residents fuming.

"I don't blame them for wanting in. The food is incredible," said Linda Adamo, 73. "But my father didn't smuggle our family out of Mussolini's Italy without a pot to piss in so that a bunch of dirty students could piss in my flower pot."

The INS has stepped up its efforts recently by going undercover. As part of "Operation Fixer-Upper," plain-clothed officers wander the streets disguised as young, just-married, professional couples at 11:30 AM, when students are returning from nights out in Oakland, and repeat loudly, "It's just the type of place to build our dreams! We could have tapas parties!" INS interpreter Carla Driscoll, a recent Pitt graduate, explains, "The kids are scared of yuppies. Scared as hell. What's the point of living in a place that even up-and-coming systems analysts know about?"

Pro-student groups, on the other hand, paint students as a blessing-in-diguise for the community.

"These students are willing to take the shitty housing no one else wants," said Mary Botticelli. "Tolerance is crucial."

She then added: "If it weren't for the students, those houses would probably be jammed with a bunch of freaking Mexicans!"
