#Pittsburgh Now Named After Brad Pitt
Originally published in [The Pittiful News](http://pittifulnews.com

After a closed-door session with Pittsburgh's foremost politicians, academics, religious leaders, and captains of industry, Mayor Ravenstahl announced Thursday morning that Brad Pitt will supplant William Pitt the Elder as the source of Pittsburgh's name. 

Ravenstahl emerged from the 10:00 AM meeting at 10:05 AM and issued the following proclamation:

  Whereas, from his Wikipedia article, William PItt the Elder looks like a fruity little mamma's boy all dressed up in his Sunday best for a flute recital; and

  Whereas, anyone who personally prefers to go by "1st Earl of Chatham" instead of "The Elder," (which is at least excusable and could be something badass from Halo or Lord of the Rings) is definitely demanding to have his rosy little white ass beat; and

  Whereas, Brad Pitt was in Snatch, Fight Club, Se7en, 12 Monkeys, and several other movies that would induce William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, to wet his flower-patterened Pull-Ups for a month; and

  Whereas, Brad Pitt got with Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Anniston, and Angelina Jolie,

  I hereby declare that, from this day forth, Pittsburgh is named after Brad Pitt! This city is back! Back on the map!

When informed of the unanimous decision Brad Pitt casually adjusted his sunglasses and cast a rakish half-smile to the sun setting over Kenya, perhaps to ask the gods what sort of awesome sh** tomorrow would hold.

"Wherever Pittsburgh is, I'm honored," he said, all the while massaging his near-perfect jawline. "I guess tonight I will sleep soundly as a stone once again, because when your life is as sweet as mine, there is nothing left to dream; and when you are as badass as me, no nightmare can frighten you."

Pitt later announced plans to convey his half-hearted gratitude to Pittsburgh by gently, but firmly, taking each female resident into a deep carnal embrace at the end of a hard day. A referendum on Pitt's proposal passed unanimously in a referendum, with 100% turnout in all precincts.

"My only regret--and I mean, literally, my only regret in my whole life--is that I wish my distant ancestor William Pitt the Elder were here to see this," Pitt said, with a brooding-yet-inviting look in his eyes. "He was a really cool guy. He did a lot for government transparency in 18th-century England."
