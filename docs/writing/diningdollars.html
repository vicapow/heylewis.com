--New York--

Markets across the globe smiled on the Dining Dollar (Symbol: $D) this morning, as the oft-maligned currency climbed to record highs against the dollar, yuan, euro, Brazilian real, and the meal block.

"This is all about three things: cereal, cereal and...what now?...cereal, motherf***ers!" explained Bellingham Benetton III, 31, of Goldman Sachs, who had made heavy bets on the Dining Dollars since Wednesday.

Benetton clarified: "Me and my ilk are making big fat stacks of filthy money! Woo hoo! We're gonna get some whores."

The gains began when, in overnight trading, the price of Apple Jacks, Wheaties, and Lucky Charms dropped 25% at Eddy's, effectively reversing the week-long retreat from the dining dollar that began when Red Bull 4-packs reached new heights on Monday. 

Once the Wall Street Journal made the announcement, dorm residents rushed to convert their dollars to dining dollars to buy the tasty cereals with the swipe of a card. Towers lobby soon took on the bedlam quality that most students only recognized from the end of Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd's Trading Places, the part when something confusing happens that involves oranges and money.

Other analysts are skeptical that the trend has legs for the long run.

"Let's face it, there is no reason for the freaking dining dollar to exist," said Peter Xiong, a sophomore from Eerie. "You can still buy things with real dollars at dining halls, and you don't get a discount for using Dining Dollars. The whole thing exists because people's parents don't believe that there could be such a complicated system with no purpose, so they buy a bunch of useless Dining Dollars just in case."

Still, the futures market for dining dollars is sending robust signals for the long-term.

"With dining dollars, you can get stuff from vending machines even if you don't have any change," said freshman Information Sciences major Libby Henderson, of Scranton. "And I heard they're going to get these new types of Bear Claws with strawberry frosting, so I'm going long on Dining Dollars."

Since the rally, the SEC is investigating the run on Dining Dollars, ever since an investigation into the snackroom of accounting giant KPMG revealed glaring inconsistencies between the taste of Apple Jacks and the taste of apples.
