# Tensions Flare Between Indian, Pakistani Food Carts

UN Secretary General Kofi Annon held a conflict resolution summit with Pittsburgh "mobile restauranteurs" Muhammad Saleem Rafiq and Anand Bosmia this morning to resolve escalating tensions between the Indian and Pakistani food carts.

Dr. Johnathan Rana, a professor of international relations at University of Pittsburgh and daily customer of both food carts, explains that at the root of the conflict is a dispute over who controls the authentic taste of Kashmir, and that the current skirmishing is only the "outward vestiges of an age-old, curry-soaked war."

"My cart has more options," claimed Rafiq at one point during the meeting. "More than just $4 small and $5 large, we also offer $4.50 medium."

Bosmia countered that his cart has plastic knives, forks, and spoons, whereas Rafiq's offers only knives and forks. Both sides have accused the other of stealing paper towels from the Cathedral of Learning bathrooms.

The drama has only recently started to attract international attention, ever since both food carts acquired "atomic hot sauce" technology over the summer.

"We're afraid that atomic sauce might fall into the wrong hands," said UN Atomic Energy/Sauce Agency chairman Hans Brinkler. "It could spell disaster if the Arab food carts at CMU get a hold of these materials."

He later clarified: "Have you ever tried really spicy falafel? It's terrible!"

As of press-time, both Rafiq and Bosmia were pessimistic about the outcome of the  summit, but extremely optimistic about the chances of U2 playing a concert to call for an end to the fighting.

"We'll definitely get no less than 30,000 people to turn out and eat our food. Of course, Bono will probably pull some stunt like mixing korma with chicken saag in a gesture symbolizing tolerance," said Bosmia.

Both Bosmia and Rafiq shuddered at the grim prospect, in a rare show of unity.
