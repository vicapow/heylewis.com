# What's in a Name? I Forget
Originally published in the [Pitt News](http://pittnews.com)

I want you to know that I'm sorry I forgot your name. I am speaking to specific individuals. You know who you are. Unfortunately, I don't and that is the issue..

In high school, things were easier. If I forgot someone's name, I would just wait until he went to the bathroom. Then I would look in the front of his textbook. Sometimes, though, the plan backfired, because people don't always write their names like they're supposed to do. Then I would end up calling someone by the name of the textbook's previous owner. Awkward! 

Even though I can't remember names, I can usually remember a personâ€™s facts and narratives. So, if you meet me for the second time, don't get offended if I call you, "Old Blue Eyes," "Clarion Kid," "Cute Girl Who Kept Leaning On Me," "Dude Attacked by Muskrat," "Total Badass Who Pulled a Fake Samurai Sword On the Guy Who Punched In His Window and Bled All Over Meyran," or "One-Sixteenth Native American Kid." 

Here I feel pressed to comment: People are just constantly telling me they are one-sixteenth Native American. One or two per week. Enough that I meet one cumulative Native American per month. The point here is that I never forget if someone is one-sixteenth Native American, which is pretty good considering it's impossible to tell from looks. So, go ahead and tell me that you're one-sixteenth Native American as soon as we meet. Then I'll have something to remember you by, and it's probably true anyway. 

You shouldn't mind people who forget names. Remembering a person's fun facts and personality quirks is more important. Just think: you can live happily for decades after forgetting your spouse's name, surprising her daily with perfect pet names that express your everlasting affection like so many Hallmark cards. But if you forget your spouse's favorite color, birthday, or something so obscure as to whom your spouse is married, the seas can get rocky.

I plan on being the type of husband who always picks the perfect present, a present that resonates with the person my wife is deep down inside, but that doesn't mean I won't be the type of husband that makes his wife wear a name tag for the first few years. As for my wife, she'll be the type that likes getting perfect presents, and also the the type who doesn't mind wearing a name tag.

And hey, forgetting names can be a blessing in disguise. I'm never tempted to gossip. People are always asking me if I hate so-and-so: "I hate Josh Green!" they say and ask, "Do you?"  I look the complainer in the face and say, "I can't remember who that is. Gossiping is crass." 

You can't talk about someone behind his back, if you can't remember who he is once you're behind his back. In fact, pretty much all you can do is make fun of his back, and backs are never objects of contempt or ridicule. "Like water off a duck's back," they say, referring to human backs. 

All I'm saying here is, "Give me a break," and "What's in a name? Your name. What letters? In what order? Thanks! Yeah I remembered I just wanted to know how you spelled John cause some people do it different."
