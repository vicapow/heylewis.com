# Freshman from Downington Repping Philadelphia Hard
Originally published in the [Pittiful News](http://www.pittifulnews.com/)

"Where's the water fountain?" asked Jeremy Larsen, 18, a fresman bio major from Downington. Several eyebrows in the area were raised at the Larsen's characteristic Philadelphia pronunciation of "water." Sources close to Larsen report that not only has Larsen only recently embraced the Philadelphia pronunciation of water, but that his use of the word "water" has skyrocketed.
"Besides all the rainwater, you know what sucks about Pittsburgh?" asked Larsen, pointing at the Primanti Brothers menu. "You can't get a real cheesesteak. Just these phoney jawns."
For the uninitiated in the vicinity, Larsen explained, in no uncertain terms, that a Philadelphia cheesesteak is made with cheese-whiz and best with mushrooms, but that "the bread is the most important part."
"It's Always Sunny is the best," Larsen later remarked for no particular reason, referring to a semi-popular FX TV show not actually filmed in Philadelphia but that nonetheless glorifies the stinking cesspool of a city.
According to Pitt counselor Amelia Vandercraft, long-time friends of Larsen need not be overly concerned at Larsen's constant references to South Street, "this one falafel place at Reading Terminal," the L train, the Philly hardcore scene, or even the horrible Rocky franchise.
"This metamorphosis is part of the cycle of college life," Vandercraft explained. "Every May, hundreds of high school seniors from across eastern PA enter a summer incubation period, and emerge three months later as fully-formed Philadelphia natives."
Experts report that life for the converts is beautiful, but short. Within a year, many will have a run-in with their natural predators: students who are actually from within the city limits of Philadelphia. Ever hungry to out the posers, these true natives can be identified by the fact they like genuinely like baseball despite being under 60. The fateful encounter between hunter and hunted is usually triggered when the proud son of Westchester, Doylestown, or even Reading makes a mistake as simple as calling Fishtown "Fishville" or confusing The Roots with Nappy Roots. When the Philadelphian identifies his prey, he swiftly consumes all of the poserâ€™s Philadelphia sports memorabilia.
Larsen himself could not be reached for comment on the likely duration of his sojourn with Philadelphianism, as he was busy rapping the Fresh Prince theme song for the third time in a day.
