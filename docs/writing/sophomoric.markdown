# Sophomore Acting Sophomoric
Originally published in the [The Pittiful News](http://www.pittifulnews.com)

Atwood Street--Friends and relatives issued a rebuke to Gene Turing yesterday, accusing the sophomore of "sophomoric behavior."
"I hate to call out my bro, but Gene is overconfident of knowledge and yet poorly informed and immature," said roommate Jerome Abernathy, an information sciences major from Punxatawney.
Accusations began in the wake of severeal bold assertions made by Turing following the close of his freshman year, including claims that "[Turing] might go to med school if aw school is too easy," "[esteemed historion] Walter Posner doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about," and "it is a scientific fact that George Foreman invented the George Foreman Grill himself."
Critics were quick to distance themselves from extremists whose blanket condemnations of the sophomore community have rankled sophomores and their allies.
"In no way to we mean to imply Turing's behavior is of, characteristic, or relating to a sophomore," explained ex-girlfriend Monique Webster, reassuring a crowd of protestors between the ages of 19 and 20. "Only that he is intellectually pretentious, conceited, etc."
Overall, Turing claims to be unmoved by the accusations, claiming, "Sophomoric is not a goddam word. The word is 'sophomorish.'"
He added: "Look it up in a freaking dictionary!"
