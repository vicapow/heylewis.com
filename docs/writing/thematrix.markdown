# Linear Algebra Student Enters the Matrix

It was a Monday like any other. A cold 24-hours of rat-race drudgery. Then, Clarence Eno, a sophomore Math-Econ major from Uniontown, entered the matrix.

The matrix, which Oden entered into the computation mathematics program "Maple," was an imposing 8x10, and included numerous fractions with relatively prime denominators.

Upon entering the matrix, however, Eno became almost supernaturally fast. Later, by downloading plug-ins, Eno even acquired abilities, in the flash of an eye, that take years to perfect in real life. 

"Once I entered the matrix, I could do anything. Anything," said Eno. "We're talking transposition, linear combinations of rows, and, hell, even Gauss-Jordan elimination."

Due to his new knack for simplifying matrices into reduced-row echelon form--an arrangement whereby every pivot column contains only a one--some members of the public have even started referring to Eno as "the one," partly because "one" is an anagram of "Eno."

However, other students complain that entering the matrix can make linear algebra homework dull.

"The first matrix was the best. The second and third were kind of boring, though," said Nivi Pandit, Oden's classmate in UHC Linear Algebra. "I guess the architect thought the only way to spice things up was to add unnecessary lines and pile on gratuitous, hackneyed f(x)'s."

The matrix was designed by Pitt Math Professor Irina Koschova, who explained, "The matrix was designed for challenge. The human mind dies without challenge."

Eno could not be reached for further comment, as he suddenly disappeared.
